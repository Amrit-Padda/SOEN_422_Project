1 - Make sure that you are using COM3 to connect to you Arduino, if this com port is unavailable, change the port referenced on line 4 of the Task4.bat file.

2 - Make sure that the COM3 port is available (no serial monitor or loader running)

3 - Run the Task4.bat file.

4 - Open a serial monitor of your choice connected to COM3, if none is available, you may run the Loader provided for task 5 (Program.cs in the Loader folder)

5 - if no results aprear on the serial monitor or loader, hit the reset button on the arduino to re-run the code. The results should appear.
